        <p>This is the game that my group made during Global Game Jam 2013 in Singapore. The team members were me, Chunmun (<a href="https://github.com/chunmun" class="user-mention">@chunmun</a>), Richard (<a href="https://github.com/rgoulter" class="user-mention">@rgoulter</a>), Vanessa and Sandra. The theme of the game jam was heart beat, so Richard came up with the idea of making a game in which the hero needs to sacrifice his HP to activate traps that kills the monsters. Quite a fun game. Was made on HTML5 and javascript, so no plugin needed.

<p>Here's a video of the game:

<p>For the game, <del>go to: <a href="https://rawgithub.com/HansNewbie/GGJ2013-Deborah/master/index.html">rawgithub.com/HansNewbie/GGJ2013-Deborah/master/index.html</a></del> I embed it in iFrame down below. If there is any trouble with the iFrame, you could click on the striked link. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rgrove" class="user-mention">@rgrove</a> and his project <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/rawgithub">https://github.com/rgrove/rawgithub</a> that you can play the game from the Github repo.</p>

<p><strong>About the game</strong>:<br/>
  <ul>
    <li>The game was made with JavaScript and HTML.</li>
    <li>The health of the character keeps decreasing to serve as a time.</li>
    <li>The Traps were set to be random, but to ensure even distribution, the traps' positions are randomed in their respectives grid thus they will not clutter in a position of the map.</li>
    <li>The offering statue would disappear if the hero is away from it</li>
    <li>The A.I. of the enemies is not perfect. It would follow a path (the path, though, is circular - the reason the enemies keep moving the same path) although not following the path directly. If you move to close to the enemies, they would be chasing you (no difference in speed, though).</li>
  </ul>
